# Project Overview
The focus for this Project was to practice working with linear models for regression. To begin, a CSV file consisting of various values and features. More specifically, the data contained 1338 samples of people and their features such as their age, sex, number of children, whether they smoke and the region, and finally the insurance charges they currently pay. The target here is the insurance charges.The first part focuses on implementing linear regression using the Ordinary Least Squares equation (OLS), and the second part focuses on implementing linear regression using gradient descent methods.
